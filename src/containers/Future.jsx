      <h2>Cult Project – A New Devised Work</h2>
      <p>Director Michael Arden (Spring Awakening Revival) and Eamon Foley have recently been collaborating
      on a devised piece of immersive dinner theater that explores the culture surrounding cults of the late 60’s and
      the experience of living within one. Creating a multi-sensory, interactive theater experience with one of the hottest
      directors of the moment and his team would help Grind burst onto the scene as the new force for exciting, innovative work.</p>

      <h2>Little Shop of Horrors</h2>
      <p>Grind is looking forward to mounting a reconceived production of Little Shop that brings to life the “B horror film” aesthetic.
      This production will focus on the dark side of sexuality that can hypnotize and lead us astray from our moral core. In this
      production, the three urchins consist of two females and one trans male. The trio also takes on the role of the plant, manning
      a giant orchid-like puppet that will be far more animated and feminized. Not only will the plant have more mobile agency, but
      the three voices will combine to create a multifaceted personality that explores the twisted, confused sexuality of our lost orphan
      “hero,” Seymour. Our Little Shop will not subscribe to cartoon depictions character and plot, but explore the allure of gore and
      shed light on the aspect of human nature that is titillated by the nuclear combination of power, sex, and blood.</p>

      <h2>Light in the Piazza</h2>
      <p>A favorite of the Grind team, we would love to explore this musical from a choreographic standpoint, and bring a new
      understanding to the role art itself plays within the piece. This gorgeous, sweeping score feels like it was meant to be danced
      to, and we imagine a production in which dance is a means of exploring the exuberant, imaginative, hyper-emotional mind of
      Clara. We hope that this will provide a beautiful opposition to the worry and fear felt by her mother, highlighting how
      differently-abled people are able to experience the world in an unconventional, sometimes more beautiful way. We are also
      excited to cast the roles of Clara and Fabrizio age appropriately, adding a danger to their young love that is often diluted by
      casting older actors.</p>

      <h2>Lulu</h2>
      <p>Hailed as the most iconic femme fatale story ever created, renowned director Michael Arden reimagines the classic for a
      Los Angeles art gallery. As the audience is herded through the expansive, winding space, they experience a new adaption of
      Lulu derived from the many prolific versions in existence. Our production will utilize dance, aerial acrobatics, and film to explore
      the many different mediums that refract the image of women in art and in life.</p>

      <h2>Falling</h2>
      <p>Michael Arden teams up with choreographers Chase Brock (The Chase Brock Experience, Spiderman Turn Off The Dark)
      and Eamon Foley to create a new musical based off the gut-wrenching poem by James L. Dickey which chronicles the true story
      of an airline stewardess being sucked out of a plane and falling 35,000 ft. The piece uses music by The Rescues along with
      dance and aerial-dance to explore this woman’s history on her way into eternal twilight.</p>

      <h2>Oh, Sean – A Short Film</h2>
      <p>In the same vein as Color + Light, we’d like to create a concept film that fleshes out the story in renowned composer Todd
      Almond’s (The Public’s The Odyssey, Noises Off) song Oh, Sean. We’ve dreamt up a site-specific dance piece that uses Studio
      54 Below, the space where Todd Almond premiered the song, as a therapeutic dream space in which a singer will face the
      romantic demons of his past. The dance will move through the entire 54 Below space from the stage and table seating area,
      to the bar, up the stairs, and eventually to the street culminating in some sort of deeper understanding of what the relationship
      was for person and why we cling to love so desperately.</p>
