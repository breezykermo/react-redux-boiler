      <h2>What We Need:</h2>
      <p>Grind Arts Company has a big year ahead. We are looking forward to producing two kick-off
      projects on both coasts that showcase the range of work these artists are capable of creating.
      Our first immersive theatrical endeavor will be a raucous reimagining of the femme fatale classic
      Lulu, helmed by director Michael Arden (Broadway revival of Spring Awakening). Taking place in
      a Los Angeles art gallery, Arden and his team of designers, choreographers, and multi-talented
      actors will devise an energetic retelling that requires the audience to move from space to space t
      o explore this story through different mediums including scene, dance, and projection. This
      unconventional approach and setting should force artists and audiences to reevaluate the
      impossible paradoxes thrust upon women. This upcoming production will be a low-budget
      workshop that will give way to a more involved Lulu with higher production value. Donors will be
      able to take part in the ground level of this piece before it is further developed for a larger budget.
      For this initial production, are working towards a budget of $50,000.</p>

      <p>On the other side of the country, film-on-dance team Eamon Foley and Graham Phillips are
      collaborating with renowned composer Todd Almond (Kansas City Choir Boy starring Courtney Love)
      to create a concept film that brings his soaring hit Oh, Sean to life. Following in the vein of their last
      film Color + Light, Phillips and Foley have dreamt up a site-specific dance piece that uses Studio 54
      Below, the space where Todd Almond premiered the song with Sherie Rene Scott, as a therapeutic
      dream space in which a singer will face the romantic demons of his past. The film will move through
      the entire 54 Below space culminating in some sort of deeper understanding of what the relationship
      in this song was and why we cling to love so desperately. This film requires $8,000 to rent the film
      and rehearsal space, lighting equipment, and a recording studio as well as pay twelve dancers and
      a small team of technicians for their time and skill.</p>

      <p>On top of these projects, Grind will host a launch event on both coasts to premiere the new work
      and introduce the public to our approach to theater. We will also be solidifying our infrastructure to
      ensure longevity, hiring designers, accountants, and website managers to help us be the most
      cost-effective and accessible theater company we can be. Altogether, we are working towards
      raising $75,000 to get these initial projects and Grind Arts Company up and running at full speed.</p>
