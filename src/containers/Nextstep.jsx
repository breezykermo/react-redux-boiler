      <p>There’s a new audience emerging in New York that doesn’t want to “see shows” anymore.
      They want to engage with theater in new, creative ways. Productions like Sleep No More, Fuerza
      Bruta, and Deaf West’s revival of Spring Awakening have loyal, enthusiastic audiences because
      you don’t just watch these shows: you experience them. These kinds of productions clearly align
      with Grind Arts Company’s mission. By tapping into our members’ combined histories on Broadway,
      in film, and at Princeton, we are building a collective of young, trailblazing artists to produce theatrical
       experiences that not only provide an innovative perspective on a text or theme, but also forward
       the art of storytelling as a whole. Audiences will know that in attending a Grind production they
       are in for a night at the theater like they have never experienced.</p>
      <p>The three major types of work that Grind will produce are reconceived classics, new devised work,
      and projects that merge the worlds of theater and film. Our productions will take place in both traditional
       theaters and found spaces such as warehouses, brownstones, and public parks. Furthermore, we are
        not exclusive to New York. Our core team is composed of artists who work in both New York City and
        Los Angeles, which enables us to curate relationships with theaters out west and establish a bicoastal
        presence. For example, one of our premiere productions will be an immersive reimagining of Lulu,
        directed by Michael Arden, that weaves through a Los Angeles art gallery and utilizes different forms
         of dance and aerial work to investigate the infamous femme fatale.  This new production, along with a
         new concept film, will help us raise funds to support a sustaining theater company.</p>
        <p>The key to longevity is a dedicated, enthusiastic community. The Grind Arts Membership is a
        non-elitist group of artists and theater lovers who hope to nourish and elevate emerging talent to
        cultivate new approaches. Our goal is to foster a symbiotic relationship between a core membership
        of distinguished professionals and the aspiring artists that will fuel the next generation of theater.
        The philanthropic initiatives that support this exchange are the Young Artists Initiative and Grind Arts U,
        which help emerging artists cultivate new work and establish mentor-mentee relationships in a
        network-dependent industry. As Grind evolves, we aim to eventually own a fully transformable
        warehouse-type theater space that could be reconfigured to accommodate the vast variety of artistic
        contributions we are interested in producing. Attached to our theater or office space will be Grind House,
        a physical space where the Grind Membership mingles and collaborates, sparking creative conversation
        between distinguished professionals, emerging artists, and our dedicated patrons to inspire exciting new work.</p>
