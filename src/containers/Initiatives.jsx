      <p>In an industry obsessed with connection, it is common for exciting new artists and their ideas
      to get pushed to the side while something more established takes center stage. The established
      choice is the safe choice, which is why it often receives the funding but doesn’t necessarily forward
      humanity. The perpetuation of the known makes it seemingly impossible for emerging creatives to
      break into the business, however Grind Arts wants to provide a way in. The Young Artists Initiative
      and Grind Arts U will inspire talented minds to pursue their craft and push artistic boundaries,
      creating a self-perpetuating system of new artists begetting new work that feeds both their careers
      and the Grind Arts cannon. These initiatives will allow Grind to constantly pull new material from
      emerging talent, helping us remain fresh and relevant as our founding membership grows.</p>

      <h2>Young Artists Initiative:</h2>
      <p>Along with cultivating a core group of artists to produce provocative, exciting theater, Grind
      Arts Company will strive to be a resource for young, motivated artists who lack the resources to
      take their promising work to the next level. Through the staging of new plays and the hosting of
      readings, workshops, and group work sessions, we will draw the most exciting and uninhibited work
      out of our generation of artists to unearth new philosophy of what theater can do and be. Projects
      and artists that inspire us could also receive logistical expertise such as the necessary forms,
      resources for equipment and space, fundraising guidance, and contact into our network of talent
      and mentors.</p>
      <p>Offering resources to young, hungry, innovative artists will help us grow and diversify our
      membership, adding new perspective to our main stage productions and keeping us on the crest
      of this new wave of theater. Grind Arts’ Young Artist Initiative will provide an escape from the
      low-level assisting jobs that have become the norm for artists under 30. By providing a home for
      young artists to create their own work, we can break the cycle of forcing aspiring, talented youth
      into positions in which they lack the agency to discover their most effective means of storytelling.</p>

      <h2>Grind Arts U:</h2>
      <p>To graduate Princeton and pursue a career in the arts is a foreign concept. The finance-centric
      culture deters talented artists from continuing to explore their passion after school. This is
      unfortunately the case with many higher educational institutions. Grind is currently fulfilling the
      need for artists on Princeton campus to have a space in which they can hone their craft with the
      focus and intensity that comes with the intention of pursuing a career in the field. Grind Arts Company
      would like to foster that ambition beyond Princeton University, inspiring the most motivated student
      artists across the country to create their best work, cultivate their unique style, and understand how
      to be the CEO of their career in the arts.</p>
      <p>Grind Arts U will offer college level students access to professional experience on Grind Arts
      productions, ranging from summer assistantships, internships, and equity-point opportunities. This
      will help outstanding student artists forge connections and build confidence so they might embark
      on a successful career in this industry.</p>

      <h2>Grind House:</h2>
      <p>Grind Arts is bolstering creative collaboration between great minds by being home to a community
      of artists and patrons. Creative conversation between varied, passionate artists and patrons is what leads
      to forward momentum in the art world. We find it imperative to our success that we foster relationships
      between a variety of artists by getting them into the same room to trade insight, skills, and eventually
      create new work. To start, Grind House will be a virtual platform that stimulates conversation, connection,
      and helps artists reach Grind-supported meetings such as Artists Anonymous, a support group for artists
      who want to make waves in the industry. Grind House will host events, panel discussions with distinguished
      artists, and support the mixing of diverse theater-makers who are interested in experimenting with new
      approaches. Down the road, Grind House will be a physical space for the Grind Membership to both
      socialize and work. We envision a lounge connected to our main theater that offers beverages and food,
      but more importantly supports the creation of new theater with access to studio space, drawing and writing
      supplies, printing facilities, and other provisions that might encourage ideas to flow.</p>
